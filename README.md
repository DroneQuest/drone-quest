# Drone Quest

Our goal is to use terminal commands to send commands to a Parrot AR Drone 2.0 and successfuly make the connect.
The end goal of this project is to hopefully be able to fly a drone using a Leap Motion Controller.


## Core Features:
- Create a python-based API that will communicate with a front-end server
- Send terminal commands to the drone, that the drone will then execute
- Send useful drone information to a front-end user interface
- Create a module that anyone with a drone can pip install, then use to control their personal drone
	
## Stretch Goals:
- Connect a Leap Motion Controller to control the drone
- Send commands via the front-end web application we have created
- Use VR goggles that will connect to the drone cameras
